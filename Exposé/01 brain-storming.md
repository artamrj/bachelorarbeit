language that i will follow is German, so my thesis will be in German.

case-study: Puris (tractus-x), what is that?
*Predictive Unit Real-Time Information Service (PURIS)*
how many components? its own puris has a frontend and backend, plus the two deeoendencie -> Tractus-X Connector	(EDC) and Digital Twin Registry (DTR)
thats mean that will be 4 pods per each PURIS instance, and i will deploy more than one instance to have more complex scenrio.
and i see obviously that i need IDP and Wallet, can i call it umbralla? or should i still call it as PURIS in this case-study?

# what am i going to do?
- Using Puris(tractus-x) and deploy it and some why and some how! like menau and automate and somthings between them
- i want to have some metrics to evaulate the results and complixity of that diffrents why i deployed.
- i should choose some tools as semi-menaul and automate to compare them plus menaul
- (optional) i can also try to compare two IaC tools like terraform and ??, compare them and use again metrics to evaluate them.
- at the end base on the metrics i will write acudemy summriy, how would complexy to use and which one to use in which situation and give some recomandation.

# title
my porpuse is to find the best title that repesent this procces that im going to do, as academic Bachelor thesis.

thats important be academic and clear to understand and short as possible.. and exctly repersent the procces.

frist question: is it a compare or an evaluation or what?

suggestions:


# problem
what is actuell problem that im going to solve? or to work on it?
the gap between manual deployment and automate deployment, and how to choose the best way to deploy based on the situation and complexity of the use case. (academicly see what is best way to deploy and how to choose it.. based on metrics and situation of use case that we have)
so the problem could formulate like this: the strategy of deployment in industrail use case is not clear, and there is no metrics to choose the best way to deploy based on the situation and complexity of use case!
and to find best the startegy to choos the best way to deploy, not deploymen and not how to deploy it self!

ask a team: how we should deploy puris in tractus-x, what is the deployment strategy that we should follow?


# motivation
this thema can we called as indusry 4.0 thema, because in industry 4.0 we have a lot of use cases that need to be deployed in diffrent ways based on the complexity of the use case and situation that we have. so thats means that this thema is very relevant to the current industry needs and also to the future needs.
the steps that we take to go to a world of full automate as today comeing age of AI that try to automate every thing, so the motivation is to find the best way to deploy in diffrent situations and complexity of use case, to help the industry to go to the next level of automation and efficiency and saving cost and time.


# what is academic question? and goal?
the academic question is:
- how to choose the best deployment strategy based on the situation and complexity of use case in industry 4.0?
- what are the metrics that can be used to evaluate the deployment strategies?
- what are the pros and cons of each deployment strategy?
- how to improve the deployment strategies based on the metrics?

the goal is to:
- to find the best deployment strategy based on the situation and complexity of use case in industry
- to define the metrics that can be used to evaluate the deployment strategies.
- to compare the pros and cons of each deployment strategy.
- to provide recommandations on how to improve the deployment strategies based on the metrics.


# methodology as metrics - i should create a plan how to do that. whats my comperson methods and for which process?
i need categories for these.. ->(- complexity of deployment
- time to deploy
- resource utilization
- scalability
- maintainability
- cost efficiency
- reliability
- flexibility
- user satisfaction
- security
- automation level
- error rate
- documentation quality
- learning curve
- community support
- integration capabilities
- update and upgrade process
- monitoring and logging capabilities
- rollback and recovery options
- customization options
- testing and validation process
- compliance with industry standards
- environmental impact
- innovation potential
- deployment speed)

what is my main metrics categories? that i will use to compare the deployment strategies? (5 categories that represent the most important things in deployment strategies)
(
- **Systemische Komplexität:** Anzahl involvierter Artefakte und Abhängigkeiten
- **Prozessuale Komplexität:** Anzahl und Struktur der Arbeitsschritte
- **Erforderlicher Aufwand:** Zeit und Arbeitsressourcen zur Durchführung
- **Fehlerrisiko:** Wahrscheinlichkeit und Auswirkung menschlicher Fehler
- **Reproduzierbarkeit:** Konsistenz und Wiederholbarkeit der Deployment-Ergebnisse
) -> is that good? what is better?

- counts of components to deploy
- count of steps to deploy
- lines of code to write (for automate and semi-automate)

### diagrams
- BPMN diagram for each deployment strategy
- dependency diagram for the components of puris and its dependencies (EDC and DTR, IDP, wallet)
- ??
- flowchart for the process of deployment for each strategy
