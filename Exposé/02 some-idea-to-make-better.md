Methodology ⚠️ (Strong, but must become measurable)

What works

Clear phases

Sensible strategy classification

Scenario-based evaluation is excellent

Main weakness

Some metrics are not operationalized

How to improve (important)
For each metric category, define how it is measured:

| Metric             | Current        | Needed                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Aufwand            | “Zeitbedarf”   | Minutes from start to running system   |
| Komplexität        | “Komponenten”  | Number of configs, files, tools        |
| Zuverlässigkeit    | “Fehlerquoten” | Failed deployments / attempts          |
| Reproduzierbarkeit | “Konsistenz”   | Same result across N runs              |
| Operierbarkeit     | “Skalierung”   | Manual steps required after deployment |
